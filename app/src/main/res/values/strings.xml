    <string name="help_text">A well-known game from the puzzle series.
            There are fields with sizes 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, where chips are located by default,
            numbered from 1 to 8, from 1 to 15, from 1 to 24, from 1 to 35, respectively.
            In addition to the standard chips, you can use your own images.
            The player can move the chips in the field at the expense of a free cell.
            \nThe goal of the game is to collect chips in a field with numbers in order,
            using as few moves as possible.
